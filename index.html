        <p>This visualisation investigates the most successful artists and songs in recent years, and the possible causes. A random selection of songs from 
          between the year 1998 and 2020 have been selected along with the Billboard end of year artist rankings from 2006 to 2021.

          <h2>Properties of Songs</h2>
          <p1>This chart looks at 5 attributes of certain <span class="pop">pop</span>, <span class="rock">rock</span> and <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> songs and attempts to discover some trends in the way these songs operate.
            <ul>
              <li><span class="title">Danceability</span> The suitability of the song for dancing.</li>
              <li><span class="title">Energy:</span> A perceptual measure of the intensity and activity of a song (e.g. high energy song feels fast, loud and noisy).</li>
              <li><span class="title">Length:</span> Song length in minutes and seconds</li>
              <li><span class="title">Liveness:</span> Probability of being recorded with a live audience.</li>
              <li><span class="title">Popularity:</span> A measure of the song's popularity from up to 100</li>
            </ul>
          It is interesting to notice in this chart how the different <span class="title">genres</span> relate to <span class="title">danceability</span>, the more danceable songs seem to have 
          lower <span class="title">energy</span> and that there appears to be 3 distinct groups of song <span class="title">length</span>. However, it doesn't appear necessarily 
          as though any of these attributes are specifically linked to the <span class="title">popularity</span> of a song </p1>
          <br>
          <p2>Click on a <span class="title">genre</span> to filter and shift click to choose more than one (click away to reset)

          <h2>Potential Sources of Song Popularity</h2>
          <p1>Taking a deeper dive into the relationship between a song's <span class="title">energy</span> and its <span class="title">popularity</span> with additional possible factors relating to 
            <span class="title">genre</span> and <span class="title">liveness</span>.
            <br>
            <br>
            It appears as though <span class="title">energy</span> still doesn't seem to have much association with <span class="title">popularity</span> and the same can be said 
            for <span class="title">liveness</span>. However, interestingly, on average, <span class="rock">rock</span> songs seem to have a higher 
            <span class="title">popularity</span> than those in the <span class="pop">pop</span> or <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> categories.
          </p1>

          <h2>Top Performing Billboard Artists in Recent Years</h2>
          <p1>In this chart, we analyse the 5 artists who have dominated the Billboard rankings over the last 15 or so years.
            <br>
            <br>
            Interestingly, all of these 5 artists fall into the <span class="pop">pop</span> or <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> <span class="title">genres</span>, 
            without any <span class="rock">rock</span> representatives despite <span class="rock">rock</span> seeming to have a higher average <span class="title">popularity</span>
            in terms of their songs
            <br>
            <br>
            We can see that over the first few years in our sample, <span class="title">Taylor Swift</span> asolutely dominated the rankings, and while she is still right up the 
            top, <span class="title">Drake</span> has slightly overtaken here in recent years. This may be just one indicator of the increasing popularity in 
            <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> music.

          <h2>Top Performing Countries</h2>
          <p1>This map illustrates the countries with the highest performing artists and the relative success of the country compared to its population
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="title">North</span> and <span class="title">Central American</span> artists have been quite succesful in the Billboard rankings along with 
            <span class="title">Eastern European</span> artists as well. It is nice to see <span class="title">Australia</span> and <span class="title">New Zealand</span> 
            feature in there as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            It seems as though country of origin or perhaps continent of origin has something to do with song or artist <span class="title">popularity</span>
