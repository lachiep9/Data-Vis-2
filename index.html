        <h1>Recent Music Performance
        </h1>
        <p>This visualisation investigates the most succesful artists and songs in recent years, and the possible causes. A random selection of songs from 
          between the year 1998 and 2020 have been selected along with the Billboard end of year artist rankings from 2006 to 2021.

          <h2>Properties of Songs</h2>
          <p1>This chart looks at 5 attributes of certain <span class="pop">pop</span>, <span class="rock">rock</span> and <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> songs and attempts to discover some trends in the way these songs operate.
            <ul>
              <li>Danceability: The suitability of the song for dancing.</li>
              <li>Energy: A perceptual measure of the intensity and activity of a song (e.g. high energy song feels fast, loud and noisy).</li>
              <li>Length: Song length in minutes and seconds</li>
              <li>Liveness: Probability of being recorded with a live audience.</li>
              <li>Popularity: A measure of the song's popularity from up to 100</li>
            </ul>
          It is interesting to notice in this chart how the different genres relate to danceability, the more danceable songs seem to have lower energy and that there appears to
          be 3 distinct groups of song length. However, it doesn't appear necessarily as though any of these attributes are specifically linked to the popularity of a song </p1>

          <h2>Potential Sources of Song Popularity</h2>
          <p1>Taking a deeper dive into the relationship between a song's energy and it's possible with additional possible factors relating to genre and liveness.
            <br>
            <br>
            It appears as though energy still doesn't seem to have much association with popularity and the same can be said for liveness. However, interestingly, 
            on average, <span class="rock">rock</span> songs seem to have a higher popularity than those in the <span class="pop">pop</span> or <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> categories.

          <h2>Top Performing Billboard Artists in Recent Years</h2>
          <p1>In this chart, we analyse the 5 artists who have dominated the Billboard rankings over the last 15 or so years.
            <br>
            <br>
            Interestingly, all of these 5 artists fall into the <span class="pop">pop</span> or <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> genres, without any <span class="rock">rock</span> representatives
            despite <span class="rock">rock</span> seeming to have a higher average popularity in terms of their songs
            <br>
            <br>
            We can see that over the first few years in our sample, Taylor Swift asolutely dominated the rankings, and while she is still right up the top, Drake has slightly 
            overtaken here in recent years. This may be just one indicator of the increasing popularity in <span class="hip-hop">hip hop</span> music.

          <h2>Top Performing Countries</h2>
          <p1>This map illustrates the countries with the highest performing artists and the relative success of the country compared to its population
            <br>
            <br>
            North and Central American artists have been quite succesful in the Billboard rankings along with Eastern European artists as well. It is nice to see Australia 
            and New Zealand feature in there as well
